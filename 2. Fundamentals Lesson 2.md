### FAQs  
- Q1: What is inference in machine learning?  
  A1: Inference is the process of using a trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data.  

- Q2: Why is data preparation important?  
  A2: Data preparation cleans and transforms raw data into a usable format, which is crucial because messy or inconsistent data often leads to poor model performance.  

- Q3: What does model architecture refer to?  
  A3: Model architecture is the structure of the neural network, including the number and arrangement of neurons and layers, which influences the model‚Äôs ability to learn patterns.  

- Q4: How is model performance evaluated?  
  A4: Performance is evaluated by testing the model on a separate set of data that was not used during training to see how accurately it predicts new outcomes.  

- Q5: Why is deployment considered a separate stage?  
  A5: Deployment involves integrating the trained model into a real-world environment, which requires additional considerations like scalability and user accessibility, so it is addressed after training and evaluation.  

### Core Concepts  
- **Systematic Machine Learning Pipeline:** The six-stage framework provides a structured approach to developing machine learning models, ensuring each critical step from data collection to deployment is addressed methodically. This framework is designed to be versatile across different problem domains.  
- **Data Handling Challenges:** Real-world data is often incomplete, inconsistent, or erroneous. Effective data ingestion and preparation are foundational tasks that demand significant time and effort to ensure the model receives reliable inputs. Techniques like handling missing values, removing duplicates, and feature engineering are fundamental.  
- **Model Design and Training:** Choosing the right model architecture is key; even simple models can be powerful if well designed. Training involves iterative optimization where the model learns patterns by minimizing prediction errors through feedback loops controlled by parameters such as learning rate.  
- **Model Evaluation:** Reliable evaluation requires testing on data unseen during training to avoid overfitting and to measure the model's generalization capabilities. Debugging during this phase helps identify and fix issues before deployment.  
- **Practical Application via PyTorch:** The concepts discussed are implemented in PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework that simplifies model definition, training, and evaluation, making it accessible for learners to engage in hands-on experimentation.  
- **Deployment Considerations:** Although deployment is the ultimate goal of machine learning projects, it involves additional complexities like system integration and user accessibility, which warrant focused attention beyond initial model development.  

This foundational overview prepares learners to apply these principles in upcoming practical labs, reinforcing theoretical knowledge with code-based experience.
